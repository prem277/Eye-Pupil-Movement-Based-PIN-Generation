# Eye-Pupil-Movement-Based-PIN-Generation

Developed an eye-movement-based PIN generation system that integrates a CNN model for classifying left and right pupil movements with real-time eye detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade, including preprocessing for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Combined deep learning and computer vision techniques for an innovative and interactive PIN generation approach and achieved 98% accuracy
